Overriding:
    Overriding happens when the same methods exists in parent and child class.
Benifits:
    We can have specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the
    Parent class. That we have this felxibility that we don't have to come up with
    different names if we are doing same thing again in the child classes.
Rules:
    1) We can change the access modifier in the child class, but we can make it only less
    restrictive. For example we can change protected or default to public, but we can not
    do the reverse.
    2) Static methods have the same rules but we use a different terminology, we say we are:
    re-declaring a method instead of overriding.
    3) return types must be same in overriding
    4) Name must be same
    5) Parameters should also be same.
