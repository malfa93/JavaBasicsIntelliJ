Wrapper Classes:
    Wrapper classes are object classes around primitive data types that have built-in methods and are used as
    objects where necessary.
    For example, in collection of framework.

    Wrapper classes provides us a mechanism to use primitive data types as objects.

Boxing
    The conversion of primitive data types into its equivalent Wrapper is calling boxing.
    Integer i = new Integer(10) // boxing

Autoboxing
    The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its equivalent Wrapper is calling boxing.
    Integer i = 10;

Unboxing
    The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types is called unboxing.
    Integer i = new Integer(10); //boxing
    int i2 = i.valueOf(); //unboxing

AutoUnboxing
    The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types is called unboxing.
    Integer i = 10; //Autoboxing
    int i2 = i; //AutoUnboxing

Collection Framework
    Collection provides architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects that represented as a single unit
    we have many interfaces and classes inside the framework to achieve this.

ArrayList
    <> Diamond Operator is used to specify the data type in the collections framework.
    ArrayList<Double> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
    add();
