Rules of casting objects/classes
1)We can store a child class object inside a parent type variable
becase inheritance is one way from Parent to child.
2)We can create array of type Parent and can store all the objects of
child classes inside that array than we can write loops to call all
methods from all the classes
3) We can not store/cast a parent class object to a child class variable
but if parent type already contains the child object, then we can get it back by casting it
