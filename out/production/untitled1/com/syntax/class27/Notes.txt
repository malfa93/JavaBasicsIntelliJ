ArrayList:
ArrayList is a class in collections framework that helps us store, delete,  retrieve and manage data easily when
compared to arrays. It has many built-in methods to manipulate the data.

Two types of lists:
1) ArrayList
2) LinkList

ArrayList used Arrays internally to store and manipulate data.

When to use ArrayList:
When you have to retrieve the data mostly.

LinkedList is used when we have to write the data in between, or in front/back of the list, most of
the time we should use LinkedList.

Properties of List(ArrayList, LinkedList):
1)To maintain the insertion order
2)We can insert duplicate data as well
