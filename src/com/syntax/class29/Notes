Maps:
    Maps are data structure that can store the data in the form of key value pair.

There are three famous types of maps:
1) HashMaps
2) LinkedHashmap
3) TreeMap

HashMap:
    Insertion order is not maintained, when we need good performance and we don't care about the order of the data
    we should use Hashmap.

LinkedHashmap:
    Insertion order is maintained slower when it comes to retrieve the data as compared to a hashmap, but better
    insertion speed than treeMaps. We use it when we need to maintain the insertion order of the data.

TreeMaps:
    TreeMaps store the data in sorted form, insertion is slow because treeMap has to compare the data with
    existing elements, retrieval is fast.

To read the data from a file, we must have the following:
1) Path(Location) if that file on our computer.
2) Appropriate program must be installed on the computer to read the data from that file,
    for example:  for xlsx we use Microsoft Excel, for .pdf files we can use Adobe Reader, for .txt files, we can use
    NotePad etc.
3) We  must also know a little about the structure of that file, for example in Excel files, data is stored in the form
    of workbooks. Inside workbooks we have sheets. Inside Sheets we have rows, columns and cells.

Why we should learn about fileHandling in Java?
1) We store sensitive data in file instead of code so that  no one can access that data. We write the code inside Java
    programs to read that info at run time from some kind if files to perform the testing, and once testing is done, we
    delete those files.
2) When we have to test web forms we don't putt all the testing data inside the code we create files for that read
    the data from those files and test those web forms.
