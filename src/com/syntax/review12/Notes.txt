Sets:
Sets in Java are special data structures that do not allow duplicate elements.

There are 3 types of sets:
1)Hashset
2)LinkedHashset
3)TreeHashset

HashSet:
    Fast but no order

LinkedHashset:
Slower than Hashset but retains the insertion order

TreeSet:
    Sorts the elements in natural order

=====================================================================================

Map is a datat structure that stores the element in the form of key value pairs

Most Famous type of Maps are:
1)HashMap
2)LinkedHashMap
3)TreeMap
4)HashTable

HashMap:
    Insertion order is not maintained, but they are the fastest. HashMaps are the mostly used in the industry.

LinkedHashMaps:
    Maintains the insertion order but  are slower than Hashmaps

TreeMap:
    Sorts the data based on keys, insertion is very slow, but retrieval is comparable to HashMap.

HasTable:
    They are thread safe

FileHandling
Reading manipulating and writing data to files is called File Handling in Java
Path = location of that file on our computer
If we want to read the data from files, we need FileInputStream
If we want to write the data to files, we use FileOutputStream
