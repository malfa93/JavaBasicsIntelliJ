Inheritance:
is a mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviors/methods
except private members(fields/methods) and constructors.
We use extends keyword to inherit from a class
Benefits:
1) Saves time to code
2) It takes less memory
3) Execution time is less
4) Code duplication is reduced

Disadvantage:
1) In Inheritance base class and child class,
both are tightly coupled. Hence, if you change the code of parent class, it will affect all the child classes

Type of Inheritance:
There are 4 major types of inheritance which supported in most OOP languages, but Java only supports 3 types with class.

1) Single, Hierarchical, Multilevel, Multiple (not supported by classes in java because of diamond problem)

Single inheritance:
If we have only one parent and one child class, it's called Single Inheritance.
